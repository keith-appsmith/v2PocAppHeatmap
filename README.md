# Support Ops Dashboard

This is a minimal prototype web application demonstrating an internal dashboard
for analysing support tickets and article coverage. It loads sample ticket and
article data from CSV files and provides filtering, tag statistics and CSV export.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Features

- Displays tickets with autogenerated summaries and tag matches
- Highlights tickets without matching help articles
- Provides basic filters for product, region, agent, team and date range
- Generates a simple bar chart of tag frequency
- Allows exporting the filtered ticket list to CSV

This prototype does not implement authentication, external ticketing system
integrations, or PDF export. It is intended as a lightweight starting point
for further development.
